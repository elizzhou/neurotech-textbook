# 1.1 Electrodes
The most fundamental technical component of neurotechnology is the electrode. There are two main types of electrodes: non-invasive and invasive, and both types include electrodes that can stimulate regions of the brain (stimulating electrodes) or detect brain signals (readout electrodes). 

# 1.1.1 Readout Electrodes
Non-invasive electrodes are placed on the surface of the head, where they detect the electrical signals our brains produce during neuronal communication. Machines can then translate these signals into visual representations of regional brain activity, or use these signals to control bioengineered devices. As such, amputees or patients suffering from paralysis can regain motor function using the machinery linked to their brain activity. In order to get more precise results, invasive electrodes are placed inside specific areas of the brain. For instance, electrodes can be inserted into a patient’s motor cortex to allow them to control a motorized prosthetic arm. This allows for intuitive and precise motor control by the user, which would not be possible with non-invasive electrodes.

# 1.1.2 Stimulating Electrodes
Aside from detecting brain signals, invasive and non-invasive electrodes can also send electrical impulses to increase brain activity by facilitating action potentials. By combining both readout and stimulating electrodes, researchers can target electrical stimuli to brain regions where it would provide the greatest benefit, based on a patient’s current brain state. Deep brain stimulation, for instance, is used to suppress the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease. Another use case is in diagnosing brain diseases by identifying abnormal brain activity through electrode readouts. 

# 1.1.3 Ethical Concerns
While interference with the brain can be helpful in managing symptoms of certain neurological disorders, it has the potential to cause irreversible damage to the patient. For example, new technologies are being designed to genetically modify neurons, and existing forms of neural stimulation can change neuron form and function. Researchers have already observed the onset of depressive disorders in patients that had no mental health issues prior to deep brain stimulation. These raise many ethical concerns. What happens when neurotechnology affects one’s self self-consciousness and identity? To tackle this issue, researchers must establish guidelines to evaluate the “sameness” of a person over time. Along with ethical concerns over identity and personhood, security and privacy of brain data is a new frontier that must be dealt with in the use of readout neurotechnology. The ability to read people’s brain signals opens the possibility for ill-intentioned parties to acquire highly sensitive information. As neurotechnology and its applications unravel, it is important to question how close man and machine should be allowed to fuse together.  All these concerns must be addressed, along with the pressing question of how close should we allow man and machine to fuse together?
