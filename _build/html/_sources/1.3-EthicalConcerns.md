# 1.2. Ethical Concerns
While interference with the brain can be helpful in managing symptoms of certain neurological disorders, it has the potential to cause irreversible damage to the patient. For example, new technologies are being designed to genetically modify neurons, and existing forms of neural stimulation can change neuron form and function. Researchers have already observed the onset of depressive disorders in patients that had no mental health issues prior to deep brain stimulation. These raise many ethical concerns, such as the possibility for neurotechnology to affect one’s self self-consciousness and identity. To tackle this issue, researchers must establish guidelines to evaluate the “sameness” of a person over time. Along with ethical concerns over identity and personhood, the ability to read people’s brain signals opens the possibility for ill-intentioned parties to acquire highly sensitive information. As such, maintining security and privacy of brain data is of utmost importance in the use of readout neurotechnology. 

As neurotechnology develops and its applications become clearer, it is important to consider the extent to which man and machine should be allowed to fuse together to prevent unnecessary complications.
