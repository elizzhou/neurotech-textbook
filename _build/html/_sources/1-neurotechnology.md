# What is Neurotechnology?

Simply put, neurotechnology is technology that is integrated with the neurobiology of an organism. The field of neurotechnology focuses on establishing communication between the nervous system and various technologies, which gives us insight into the inner workings of the brain and also allows us to design tools and treatments for those with neurological diseases, among other things. Some relevant tools in the field of neurotechnology include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machines that measure brain activity, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) devices that send electrical currents to the brain to alter the communication between neurons, and artificial intelligence (AI), in which computer systems complete tasks ordinarily done by humans. Both of these will be discussed further in Chapter 4.

The most fundamental technical component of neurotechnology is the electrode. There are two main types of electrodes: non-invasive and invasive, and both types include electrodes that can stimulate regions of the brain (stimulating electrodes) or detect brain signals (readout electrodes). Non-invasive electrodes are placed on the surface of the head, where they detect the electrical signals our brains produce during neuronal communication. Machines can then translate these signals into visual representations of regional brain activity, or use these signals to control bioengineered devices. As such, amputees or patients suffering from paralysis can regain motor function using the machinery linked to their brain activity. In order to get more precise results, invasive electrodes are placed inside specific areas of the brain. For instance, electrodes can be inserted into a patient’s motor cortex to allow them to control a motorized prosthetic arm. This allows for intuitive and precise motor control by the user, which would not be possible with non-invasive electrodes.
Aside from detecting brain signals, invasive and non-invasive electrodes can also send electrical impulses to increase brain activity by facilitating action potentials. By combining both readout and stimulating electrodes, researchers can target electrical stimuli to brain regions where it would provide the greatest benefit, based on a patient’s current brain state. Deep brain stimulation, for instance, is used to suppress the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease. Another use case is in diagnosing brain diseases by identifying abnormal brain activity through electrode readouts. 

While interference with the brain can be helpful in managing symptoms of certain neurological disorders, it has the potential to cause irreversible damage to the patient. For example, new technologies are being designed to genetically modify neurons, and existing forms of neural stimulation can change neuron form and function. Researchers have already observed the onset of depressive disorders in patients that had no mental health issues prior to deep brain stimulation. These raise many ethical concerns. What happens when neurotechnology affects one’s self self-consciousness and identity? To tackle this issue, researchers must establish guidelines to evaluate the “sameness” of a person over time. Along with ethical concerns over identity and personhood, security and privacy of brain data is a new frontier that must be dealt with in the use of readout neurotechnology. The ability to read people’s brain signals opens the possibility for ill-intentioned parties to acquire highly sensitive information. As neurotechnology and its applications unravel, it is important to question how close man and machine should be allowed to fuse together.  All these concerns must be addressed, along with the pressing question of how close should we allow man and machine to fuse together?
